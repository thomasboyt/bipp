# Bipp [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thomasboyt/bipp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thomasboyt/bipp) [![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/thomasboyt/bipp.svg?label=ready&title=Ready)](http://waffle.io/thomasboyt/bipp)

This is a music game + engine I'm working on.

### Install

You're probably going to want `node@4.x` and `npm@3.x`.

Then:

```
npm install
```

### Run

```
npm run-script dev
```

Navigate to `localhost:8080/songs-list` and you should be in business. I recommend loading the demo song and chart in the `demo/` folder.

### Test

```
npm run-script karma
```

Will run tests in Chrome.

### Editor Manual

```
sdf<space>jkl - set the 7 columns
p - toggle playback
up/down keys - move up and down
left/right keys - select movement resolution
pgup/pgdown - move up and down by measure
plus/minus - increase/decrease space between beats (think speed multipliers)
```
